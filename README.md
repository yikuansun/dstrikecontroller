## API key setup
Sign up for [Ably](https://ably.com/). Create a new app. In the dashboard, select your app and view the API key. Give the API key permissions to push and subscribe. Copy the API key into a file called `api_key.js`. Put the file into this repository (cloned locally). In the file, type `const API_KEY = "Whatever your API key is";`.
